Subject: {{first_name}}, should I send over the DripEmails setup guide?

Hi {{first_name}},

Happy to send a quick setup guide if helpful.

With DripEmails.org, you can:
- connect Gmail or IMAP,
- auto-engage inbound contacts,
- run timed drip campaigns,
- track opens/clicks and campaign performance.

You can personalize every step using variables like {{first_name}} and {{email}}.

Typical first message:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

Want me to send the guide for {{company_name}}?

Thanks,

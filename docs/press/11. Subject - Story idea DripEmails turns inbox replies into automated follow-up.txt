Subject: Story idea: DripEmails turns inbox replies into automated follow-up

Hi {{first_name}},

I’m reaching out with a product story your audience might find useful.

DripEmails.org helps teams connect Gmail or IMAP and automatically follow up with people they’ve already emailed—using human-style messages like:

“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

Why this is interesting now:
- Teams are overloaded with inbox follow-up and lead leakage
- Most tools focus on outbound blasts, not inbound relationship automation
- DripEmails combines inbox integration + drip campaigns + AI writing + analytics in one workflow

What’s new/unique:
- Gmail and IMAP auto-engagement
- Auto-created campaigns/lists with dedupe-safe behavior
- Personalized templates with variables like {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Practical operations support (cron processing, SMTP support, API workflows)

If helpful, I can share:
- a short demo
- screenshots
- customer-style use cases
- founder interview availability

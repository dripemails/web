Subject: {{first_name}} {{last_name}}, story idea: DripEmails.org helps teams automate real inbox follow-up

Hi {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

I wanted to share a press story idea that may be a fit for your audience.

DripEmails.org is an email automation platform focused on a practical gap: what happens after someone replies or engages.

Instead of only sending outbound campaigns, DripEmails lets teams connect Gmail or IMAP and automatically continue conversations with personalized follow-up workflows.

Why this angle is timely:
- Inboxes are overloaded and high-intent replies often go cold
- Many tools optimize top-of-funnel blasts, but fewer handle inbound follow-up well
- Teams want automation that still sounds human and personal

What DripEmails.org offers:
- Gmail + IMAP auto-engagement workflows
- Multi-step drip campaigns with flexible timing
- AI-assisted drafting and revision for campaign emails
- Personalized templates with merge fields like {{first_name}}, {{last_name}}, and {{email}}
- Campaign analytics (opens, clicks, and engagement tracking)

If useful, I can share:
- a short platform walkthrough
- screenshots and product notes
- customer-style use cases
- founder interview availability

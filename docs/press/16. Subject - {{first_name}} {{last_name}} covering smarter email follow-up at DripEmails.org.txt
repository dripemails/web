Subject: {{first_name}} {{last_name}}, possible coverage: DripEmails.org and the shift to inbound follow-up automation

Hi {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

Sharing a quick story pitch in case it is relevant for your publication.

DripEmails.org helps teams automate the part of email work that is often missed: consistent, personalized follow-up after real inbox engagement.

Most platforms are built around outbound sends. DripEmails adds a workflow for what happens next by connecting Gmail or IMAP and running follow-up sequences automatically.

Why this could be a strong press angle:
- High-intent conversations frequently stall due to manual workload
- Teams are looking for practical automation, not just bigger send volume
- Personalization and timing now matter more than one-time blasts

Product highlights:
- Gmail + IMAP integration for inbox-aware automation
- Configurable multi-step drip sequences
- AI-assisted writing and message revision
- Merge-field personalization including {{first_name}}, {{last_name}}, and {{email}}
- Engagement analytics for optimization over time

Happy to provide anything useful for coverage:
- 10-minute product walkthrough
- screenshots and feature notes
- real-world usage scenarios
- founder Q&A availability

Subject: {{first_name}}, story angle: how DripEmails.org automates inbound email follow-up

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share a quick press pitch that might fit your coverage.

DripEmails.org focuses on a common gap in email tools: what happens after someone replies or re-engages.

While many platforms emphasize outbound campaigns, DripEmails helps teams connect Gmail or IMAP and automate personalized follow-up from real inbox activity.

Why this story could resonate now:
- Teams are losing high-intent conversations due to manual follow-up overload
- Inbox workflows are becoming as important as outbound send volume
- Better timing and personalization are driving stronger response rates

Key product points:
- Gmail + IMAP inbox-aware automation
- Flexible multi-step drip campaign sequencing
- AI-assisted drafting and revision
- Personalization with merge fields like {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Engagement analytics for continuous optimization

If useful, I can share:
- a quick 10-minute walkthrough
- screenshots and product notes
- practical use-case examples
- founder interview availability

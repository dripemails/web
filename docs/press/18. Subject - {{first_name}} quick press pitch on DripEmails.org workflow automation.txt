Subject: {{first_name}}, quick press pitch: DripEmails.org turns inbox replies into automated workflows

Hi {{first_name}},

Reaching out with a fast story idea for your publication.

DripEmails.org helps teams automate a high-friction part of email ops: follow-up after real inbox engagement.

Instead of relying only on outbound campaigns, teams can connect Gmail or IMAP and trigger personalized sequences from inbound activity.

Why this matters:
- Manual follow-up causes avoidable pipeline leakage
- Teams need automation for both outbound and inbound journeys
- Personalized timing is increasingly tied to conversion quality

What stands out:
- Gmail + IMAP integrations
- Multi-step drip automation with flexible delays
- AI-assisted email drafting and revision
- Personalization via merge fields like {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Engagement analytics for ongoing improvement

Happy to share a demo, screenshots, and use-case examples if useful.

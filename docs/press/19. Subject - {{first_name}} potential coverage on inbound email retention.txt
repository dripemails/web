Subject: {{first_name}}, potential coverage: DripEmails.org and inbound email retention

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to send over a press angle that may be relevant to your audience.

DripEmails.org is focused on helping teams retain more value from conversations already happening in their inbox.

By connecting Gmail or IMAP, teams can automate follow-up messages, keep conversations active, and reduce missed opportunities.

Coverage angle:
- Inbound reply management is often under-automated
- Teams are prioritizing relationship continuity over one-off blasts
- Workflow speed and personalization are now core growth levers

Product highlights:
- Inbox-aware automation via Gmail + IMAP
- Configurable drip sequences for follow-up timing
- AI tools for generating and refining message copy
- Merge fields like {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Open/click and engagement tracking

If helpful, I can share a short walkthrough and a founder Q&A.

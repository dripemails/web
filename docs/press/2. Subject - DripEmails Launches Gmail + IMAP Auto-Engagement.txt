Subject: DripEmails Launches Gmail + IMAP Auto-Engagement

Hi [First Name],

DripEmails.org just launched a simpler way to automate follow-up from real inbox conversations.

You can now connect Gmail or IMAP and automatically engage inbound contacts with helpful replies like:

“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

Key highlights:
- Gmail + IMAP integrations for automated inbox follow-up
- Multi-step drip campaigns with timed sequencing
- AI-assisted email generation and revision
- Subscriber lists, segmentation, and import/export
- Analytics dashboard for opens, clicks, and campaign performance
- Built-in SMTP and API-friendly architecture

If you’d like a quick demo, we can show your first connected inbox and live auto-reply workflow in minutes.

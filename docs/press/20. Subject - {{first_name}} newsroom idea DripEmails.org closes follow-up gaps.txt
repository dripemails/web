Subject: {{first_name}}, newsroom idea: DripEmails.org helps teams close email follow-up gaps

Hi {{first_name}},

Sharing a concise product story pitch.

DripEmails.org enables teams to automate personalized follow-up after inbox interactions, not just outbound sends.

With Gmail or IMAP connected, the platform helps teams keep warm conversations moving through sequenced, context-aware outreach.

Why it could be timely coverage:
- Teams are stretched thin across fragmented inbox workflows
- Missed follow-up is a hidden revenue and engagement drain
- AI-assisted personalization is moving from optional to expected

Core capabilities:
- Gmail + IMAP integrations
- Multi-step campaign sequencing
- AI-assisted message creation and revision
- Personalization with {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Analytics for response and engagement trends

If useful, I can send screenshots, product notes, and interview availability.

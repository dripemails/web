Subject: {{first_name}}, coverage idea: reducing inbox follow-up drop-off with DripEmails.org

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a quick press angle you might find relevant.

DripEmails.org helps teams reduce follow-up drop-off by automating personalized responses after real inbox engagement.

By connecting Gmail or IMAP, teams can keep active conversations moving instead of losing momentum to manual backlog.

Why this is timely:
- High-intent replies often go stale without structured follow-up
- Teams want practical automation beyond one-off outbound sends
- Consistent timing + personalization is increasingly tied to outcomes

Product highlights:
- Gmail + IMAP inbox integration
- Configurable drip follow-up workflows
- AI-assisted copy generation and revision
- Merge fields including {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Engagement analytics for optimization

If useful, I can share a short walkthrough and founder interview availability.

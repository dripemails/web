Subject: {{first_name}}, story pitch: inbox-first email automation at DripEmails.org

Hi {{first_name}},

Sharing a concise product story idea for your publication.

DripEmails.org takes an inbox-first approach: automate follow-up from real engagement signals, not only outbound campaign schedules.

Teams connect Gmail or IMAP, then run personalized sequences that help maintain continuity in active conversations.

Coverage angle:
- Inbound workflows are still underserved in many marketing stacks
- Teams are prioritizing relationship continuity and response quality
- AI is improving workflow speed without removing personalization

What DripEmails.org includes:
- Gmail + IMAP connectivity
- Multi-step drip sequences with flexible timing
- AI-assisted drafting and edits
- Personalization using {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Open/click tracking and campaign insights

Happy to provide screenshots, product notes, and a quick demo.

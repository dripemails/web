Subject: {{first_name}}, possible feature: Gmail + IMAP continuity workflows from DripEmails.org

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to send a potential feature angle that may fit your audience.

DripEmails.org helps teams turn inbox activity into structured follow-up workflows so fewer conversations go cold.

Instead of manual reminders, teams use Gmail or IMAP integrations to trigger sequenced, personalized touchpoints automatically.

Why it could be a strong story:
- Teams are managing larger inbox volumes with leaner resources
- Follow-up consistency is now a major performance lever
- Practical automation is replacing fragmented one-off tools

Core capabilities:
- Inbox-aware automation via Gmail + IMAP
- Flexible drip sequence timing
- AI-assisted email writing and refinement
- Merge fields like {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Analytics for opens, clicks, and engagement

If helpful, I can share a brief walkthrough and Q&A with the founders.

Subject: {{first_name}}, newsroom angle: performance impact of follow-up automation

Hi {{first_name}},

I’m reaching out with a possible coverage angle around modern email operations.

DripEmails.org helps teams automate personalized follow-up from inbox engagement, improving consistency where manual workflows often break.

With Gmail or IMAP connected, teams can run timed sequences and keep high-intent conversations active.

Angle summary:
- Manual follow-up creates avoidable leakage in active conversations
- Teams are moving from campaign-only tooling to lifecycle workflows
- Better follow-up timing supports stronger engagement outcomes

Product snapshot:
- Gmail + IMAP integrations
- Configurable multi-step drip campaigns
- AI-assisted content generation and revision
- Merge-field personalization ({{first_name}}, {{email}})
- Tracking for opens, clicks, and campaign behavior

Happy to provide a short demo and background materials if useful.

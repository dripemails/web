Subject: {{first_name}}, press note: keeping inbound conversations active with DripEmails.org

Hi {{first_name}},

Sending over a quick press note in case this is relevant for upcoming coverage.

DripEmails.org is built to help teams keep inbound conversations active through automated, personalized follow-up workflows.

By connecting Gmail or IMAP, teams can trigger sequenced responses after engagement and reduce missed opportunities.

Why this matters now:
- Conversation continuity is becoming central to email performance
- Teams need workflow automation that still feels personal
- Inbound follow-up remains a common operational gap

Highlights:
- Gmail + IMAP automation support
- Sequenced drip campaigns with flexible delays
- AI-assisted draft creation and editing
- Personalization fields including {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Analytics to measure engagement trends

If useful, I can send a quick walkthrough, screenshots, and use-case examples.

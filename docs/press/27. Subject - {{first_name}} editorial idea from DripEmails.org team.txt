Subject: {{first_name}}, editorial idea from the DripEmails.org team

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a potential editorial angle your readers may find useful.

DripEmails.org helps teams automate follow-up after inbox engagement, combining Gmail/IMAP integration with personalized drip workflows.

This approach addresses a frequent gap: outbound tools send messages, but inbound conversations often lack consistent next steps.

Potential story themes:
- The shift from campaign-only email stacks to continuity workflows
- How teams reduce manual follow-up load without losing personalization
- The role of AI-assisted messaging in practical day-to-day operations

Product highlights:
- Gmail + IMAP connectivity
- Multi-step, timed drip sequences
- AI-assisted writing and revision
- Merge fields such as {{first_name}} and {{email}}
- Engagement tracking and optimization data

If helpful, I can share a demo, screenshots, and founder interview availability.

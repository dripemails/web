Subject: Founder Note — Why We Built DripEmails.org

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to personally share what we’re building at DripEmails.org.

Most email tools make teams bounce between inboxes, campaign tools, and spreadsheets. We built DripEmails to unify that workflow: connect Gmail or IMAP, then automatically follow up with thoughtful drip responses whenever a conversation starts.

A simple example:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

From there, DripEmails can continue the sequence automatically using your campaign timing rules.

What matters most to us:
- Practical automation (not complexity)
- Strong campaign and list management
- AI help for writing and editing emails faster
- Real analytics to improve results
- Flexible infrastructure (SMTP support, APIs, and ops-friendly workflows)

If this is relevant to your team, I’d be glad to give you a walkthrough and help set up your first auto-engagement flow.

Thank you for taking a look.

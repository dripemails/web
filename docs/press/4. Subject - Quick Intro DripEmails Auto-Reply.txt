Subject: Quick Intro — DripEmails Auto-Reply

Hi [First Name] — quick intro:

DripEmails.org lets you connect Gmail or IMAP and automatically follow up with inbound contacts using drip campaigns.

Example reply:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

It also includes AI-assisted email writing, list/subscriber management, and campaign analytics.

If useful, I can share a 10-minute walkthrough.

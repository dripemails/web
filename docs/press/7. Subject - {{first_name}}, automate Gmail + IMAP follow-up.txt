Subject: {{first_name}}, automate Gmail + IMAP follow-up

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick note: DripEmails.org helps teams automatically follow up on inbound email by connecting Gmail or IMAP and triggering smart drip responses.

For example, after someone writes in, your first response can be:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

Then your sequence can continue with timed follow-ups using variables like {{first_name}}, {{last_name}}, and {{email}}.

If you want, I can share a sample setup tailored to {{company_name}}.

Best,

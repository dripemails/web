Subject: {{first_name}}, want a 10-minute DripEmails walkthrough?

Hi {{first_name}},

Would you be open to a quick walkthrough of DripEmails.org?

In 10 minutes, I can show you how to:
1) connect Gmail or IMAP,
2) launch an auto-reply campaign,
3) and send personalized responses using fields like {{first_name}} and {{email}}.

A common first-touch message teams use is:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

If that’s useful for {{company_name}}, reply with a time that works for you.

Best regards,

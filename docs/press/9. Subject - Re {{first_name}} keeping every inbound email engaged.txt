Subject: Re {{first_name}}: keeping every inbound email engaged

Hi {{first_name}},

Most teams lose momentum after inbound emails because follow-up slips.

DripEmails.org solves that by connecting Gmail/IMAP and automatically sending relevant follow-up sequences with personalization variables:
- {{first_name}}
- {{last_name}}
- {{email}}
- {{subject}}

Starter message example:
“I noticed we corresponded. Did you have any questions?”

If you’d like, I can send a ready-to-import campaign for {{company_name}}.

Best,

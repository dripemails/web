    <p><strong>Subject: Thought you might find this interesting – we just launched DripEmails.org 🚀</strong></p>

    <p>Hi [Name],</p>

    <p>
        I hope this email finds you well! I'm reaching out because I've been following your work on 
        [publication name], especially your recent piece on [relevant article]. Your insights on 
        [topic] really resonated with me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted to share something that I think might be up your alley – we just launched 
        <strong>DripEmails.org</strong>, and honestly, it's a bit of a game-changer in the email 
        marketing space.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Here's what makes it interesting:</strong></p>

    <p>
        We built the first <span class="highlight">100% open-source email marketing platform</span> 
        that's actually designed for real people to use. No vendor lock-in, no crazy pricing tiers, 
        no artificial limits on subscribers. Just a powerful, modern tool that businesses can actually own.
    </p>

    <p>The thing that really sets it apart:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Intelligent Auto-Responder System</strong> – Here's where it gets really cool: 
            DripEmails.org can automatically email your entire inbox with a sophisticated auto-reply 
            system that doesn't just send canned responses. It keeps people engaged, locked in, and 
            maintains conversations even when you're not available. Think of it as having a smart 
            assistant that knows exactly how to keep your audience warm and interested.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Zero-configuration development</strong> – We solved the nightmare of Windows 
            development. No Redis setup, no Celery configuration headaches. It just... works. 
            (Trust me, developers will love this!)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI-powered content generation</strong> – Built-in AI helps create email content, 
            subject lines, and even analyzes campaign themes using machine learning
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Built-in SMTP server</strong> – Companies can run their entire email infrastructure 
            without relying on third-party services (available as a standalone PyPI package)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smart automation</strong> – Drip campaigns that automatically sequence emails based 
            on timing, A/B testing, real-time analytics – the works
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Why this might matter to your readers:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Email marketing platforms have become expensive black boxes. Companies like Mailchimp charge 
        $350/month for 10,000 subscribers. DripEmails.org? Free. Forever. Open-source, MIT licensed, 
        and built with Django and modern web tech (React, TypeScript, Tailwind).
    </p>

    <p>
        We're seeing a shift where businesses want to <em>own their data</em> and 
        <em>control their infrastructure</em>. This is especially relevant in the era of GDPR and 
        increasing privacy concerns. Plus, with AI integration becoming table stakes, we've made it 
        accessible without the enterprise price tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>The auto-responder angle is particularly interesting:</strong> Most email marketing 
        tools just send broadcasts. DripEmails.org actually <em>responds</em> to your inbox – maintaining 
        engagement loops that keep subscribers interested and prevent them from going cold. It's like 
        having a 24/7 engagement manager that never sleeps, never forgets to follow up, and always 
        knows the right thing to say to keep the conversation going. This is huge for conversion rates 
        and long-term customer retention.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The human angle:</strong></p>

    <p>
        This project started because small businesses and developers were tired of being squeezed by 
        subscription pricing and feature paywalls. We wanted to democratize email marketing – make 
        enterprise-level tools available to everyone, not just companies with big marketing budgets.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'd love to chat more if you think this might be interesting to your audience. I can provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A full demo of the platform</li>
        <li>Technical deep-dive with our development team</li>
        <li>Case studies from early adopters</li>
        <li>Screenshots, videos, or whatever would be most helpful</li>
        <li>Access to test the platform yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        No pressure at all – I know you're swamped. But if this sounds like something that would 
        resonate with your readers, I'd be thrilled to help however I can.
    </p>
